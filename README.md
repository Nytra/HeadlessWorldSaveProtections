# HeadlessWorldSaveProtections

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) Headless Client that sets world access level to private and disables away kick while the world is saving. This is to reduce the likelihood of crashing by users joining or leaving while the world is saving. The previous access level and away kick setting will be restored once saving finishes.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [HeadlessWorldSaveProtections.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/HeadlessWorldSaveProtections/releases/latest/download/HeadlessWorldSaveProtections.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\HeadlessClient\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
